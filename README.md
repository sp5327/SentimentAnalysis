In the generation where pretty much everything is dependant on social media it is extremely important for product based companies to have an idea of how their brand is being perceived. If you own or manage a business it is very likely that your customers have read and researched about you before their first interaction. Therefore it is extremely important for a brand to maintain a engaging social media presence. 


This is where Sentiment Analysis appears. Sentiment analysis can be used by product based companies to get a brief idea of customer’s reaction to the product via twitter or other social media platforms. It gives them a good idea about what’s being said about their brand and their competitors.
Sentiment Analysis tries to detect and classify the audience’s reaction to a product and assign an emotion to it. It then gives an overall evaluation of people’s reaction to the product launch and its marketing.
